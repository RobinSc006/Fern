# Fern
A live Barnsley Fern plotter. That's it.

## Info
I did this as a quick, fun project for myself and as an exercise to practice rust, 
but I didn't have any public repositories, so I thought I'd just 
showcase a few of my personal projects, this one included. 


Pressing the spacebar un/pauses the generation.

R resets the generation.

Keys 1, 2 change the color scheme.

This is a screenshot of the program generating the fractal, 1,000 iterations every 10ms.
